# arrhythmia

For the past two years, I have worked with MEG data and used an ECG to detect heartbeats artifacts to then be removed from the MEG data - it's even come to the point where I have used magnetomers to detect heartbeats instead of placing an ECG. I came across this dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and figured it would be a nice re-introduction to using ECG metrics for something other than artifact detection as well as re-igniting my enthusiasm for the modality.
